    "extraction_notes": "DOCUMENT TYPE: This is a Confidential Information Memorandum (CIM) for a debt financing transaction, specifically for $1,775m and €250m Senior Secured Credit Facilities. This is NOT an equity sale or M&A transaction, so traditional valuation multiples and asking prices are not applicable. CURRENCY: All financial figures are in EUR (Euros) unless otherwise specified. Some figures provided in USD are converted at 1.293 USD/EUR exchange rate. UNITS: Financial statement figures are in millions (€m) as explicitly stated in tables. When extracting to JSON, converted to actual amounts (e.g., €14,500m = 14,500,000,000). YEAR NOTATION: Document uses '2009A', '2010A', '2011A' for actual years and 'LTM Q3 2012' for last twelve months ending Q3 2012. Projections referenced as '2015E'. ADJUSTED EBITDA DEFINITION: Company provides detailed reconciliation showing Adjusted EBITDA = Adjusted Operating Income + D&A (excluding PPA) + Share Based Payments + Other Non-Cash Operating Profit Adjustments. GENESYS: Enterprise segment included Genesys business in 2009-2010, which was disposed in 2011. Some historical comparisons affected. GUARANTOR COVERAGE: Proposed guarantor package covers 43% of sales, 159% of EBITDA (can exceed 100% due to losses at non-guarantors), 53% of assets. This is explicitly stated and not inferred. PENSION LIABILITIES: Significant pension and OPEB obligations of €6.2bn partially offset by prepaid pension costs of €3.3bn on asset side. RESTRICTED CASH: €816m of cash restricted, €1.2bn including marketable securities in countries with exchange controls. RISK IDENTIFICATION: Risks identified from both explicit statements (leverage, revenue decline, margin compression, European weakness) and inferred from financial analysis (working capital pressure, customer concentration, execution risk, technology transition). CONFIDENCE SCORING: High confidence (0.9+) for explicit financial data from tables. Medium confidence (0.7-0.85) for strategic statements and market data. Lower confidence (0.4-0.7) for inferred risks and competitive dynamics. MISSING DATA: Employee count not provided. Specific management team names and backgrounds not detailed. Customer concentration percentages not quantified. Inventory and AR turnover cannot be calculated without average balances. CALCULATION NOTES: Current ratio = 10,741/8,044 = 1.34. Debt to equity = 19,396/4,175 = 4.65. EBITDA margin = 689/14,500 = 0.048. Net debt to EBITDA = (4,778-4,705)/689 = 0.11x (note: very low due to high cash balance). Historical CAGR 2009-LTM Q3 2012 = ((14,500/15,157)^(1/3.75))-1 = -1.4%. Projected CAGR LTM Q3 2012-2015E = ((15,200/14,500)^(1/2.25))-1 = 1.5%.
