UNITS: All financial figures are in dollars (not thousands or millions) based on context from tables showing values like $957 million and $111.9 million. Revenue figures labeled 'Total Sales' include net product sales plus fees/other income (primarily delivery fees). CALCULATIONS: (1) Historical CAGR calculated as ((957/618)^(1/5))-1 = 9.6%. (2) EBITDA margin calculated as 111.9M / 957M = 11.7% for LTM. (3) CapEx % revenue = 22M / 957M = 2.3%. (4) Net debt to EBITDA = (372.7M - 66.3M) / 111.9M = 2.7x. (5) Debt to equity = 372.7M / 201.6M = 1.85x. (6) Pro forma leverage metrics provided directly in document. (7) FCF calculated from Adjusted EBITDA less CapEx per document methodology.
