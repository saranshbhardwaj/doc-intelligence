Arion Bank is the second largest bank in Iceland, established in 2008 from assets transferred from failed Kaupthing Bank. The Bank has successfully navigated the post-crisis restructuring period and is now positioned as a universal bank serving corporate, retail, asset management, and investment banking segments. Key investment highlights include: (1) Strong capital position with Tier 1 ratio of 18.2% and Capital adequacy ratio of 23.0%, well above regulatory minimums; (2) Significant improvement in asset quality with NPL ratio declining from 24.7% (2010) to 6.6% (9M 2012); (3) Diversified business model with 100,000+ retail customers across 25 branches, ISK 769 billion in assets under management, and comprehensive corporate banking services; (4) Strong wholesale funding position with no significant redemption until 2020 following covered bond programme launch; (5) Exposure to recovering Icelandic economy with GDP growth of 2.6% (2012) and improving sovereign credit ratings (Baa3/BBB-/BBB). Key risks include customer concentration (top 10 = 22% of loans), high leverage (debt-to-equity 6.0x), legacy issues from Kaupthing relationship, capital controls, and loans-to-deposits ratio of 126%.

CURRENCY: All financial figures are in ISK (Icelandic kr\u00f3na) unless otherwise noted. EUR equivalents provided in document using period-specific exchange rates. ASSUMPTIONS: (1) 'Operating income' used as proxy for revenue as this is a bank with different income statement structure; (2) EBITDA calculated as Earnings before tax + Depreciation and amortisation where possible; (3) Historical CAGR calculated from operating income 2009-2011; (4) Debt-to-equity ratio calculated from balance sheet (total liabilities / stockholders' equity); (5) Return on equity and return on assets taken directly from key data table for 9M 2012. MISSING DATA: (1) No projected financials beyond 9M 2012; (2) CapEx not broken out separately in cash flow statements; (3) Detailed management team names not provided in document; (4) Current assets/liabilities breakdown not provided; (5) Working capital not explicitly stated; (6) Inventory and accounts receivable data not applicable for banking entity. DATA QUALITY: Document is well-structured with clear financial tables. Confidence is high for explicitly stated figures. Some metrics required calculation from available data. SPECIAL NOTES: (1) Bank has significant covered bond obligations creating priority claims (ISK 120 billion mortgage portfolio); (2) Kaupthing creditors own 87% of Bank; (3) Iceland maintains capital controls from 2008 crisis; (4) Bank subject to special taxes on financial institutions (6% profit tax, 6.75% payroll tax); (5) Strong improvement in asset quality metrics from 2010 to 9M 2012.
